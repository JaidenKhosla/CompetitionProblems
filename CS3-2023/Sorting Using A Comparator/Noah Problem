Program Name: Noah.java Input File: noah.dat
Noah is a columnist for his school’s newspaper and he’s writing an article on the most driven
vehicles among the student body. He has already collected the data in regard to the make, model,
and year of each student’s individual vehicle. The problem is his data is all over the place and
needs to be organized so that he can analyze it. Can you write a program that will sort all the data
alphabetically by make, model, then year as well as display the breakdown of each vehicle by
make, model and year?
Input: Input starts with a line containing an integer N (1<=N<=40), the number of students who
drive a car at Noah’s school. The following N lines will contain the make, model, year for each
vehicle Noah collected data for. The make, model, year will be separated by a comma.
Output: The output for this program is broken into four portions:
1) Data Sorted
2) Make Breakdown
3) Model Breakdown
4) Year Breakdown
The Data Sorted portion is displayed alphabetically by make, with the tiebreaker being model. If
there is then a tie between both make and model, the final tiebreaker is year which is displayed
from lowest to highest.
For the make, model, and year breakdowns, the output is the number of occurrences of each. It is
important to note that each breakdown is sorted. Make and model are sorted alphabetically, and
year is sorted numerically from lowest to highest.
